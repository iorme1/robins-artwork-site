# Robin's Art/Poetry/Music Site
I made this website for my dad so that he could upload and his artwork, music,
and poetry collection. It contains artwork such as photography, acrylics, paintings,
and sculptures. The audio section is his guitar/vocals, and the poetry section displays all of his poems.

## Tech Details
Built with Ruby on Rails.
Carrier wave/mini magick and AWS for image/audio uploading.
